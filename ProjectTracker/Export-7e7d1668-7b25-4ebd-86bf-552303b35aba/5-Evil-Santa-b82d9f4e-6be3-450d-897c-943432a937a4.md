Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary:
In this game, Santa Claus is an interdimensional robber who is obsessed with delivering stolen goods to anyone below the age of 18.
As santa clause, you will have to steal items from stores and put them on your reindeer catriage. Once you have gathered the required items, you will have to leave through your reindeer escape vehicle and lose your pursuers. Once you lose your pursuers, you will have to pick a targeted house and find a way to enter their home. The player can choose multiple options for this, silent or loud, silent usually involves sneaking and using opportunities, loud usually involves unnecessary destructions and provoking NPCs, e.g break down / Pick the door, climb through door the windows, Jump through the chimney. Once the present is delivered, the player has to leave and escape any pursuers.
If player provoked an enemy, he must hide, apologise or fight. The enemy may call the cops or display/rebuke affection or even attack the player. The player can attack any NPC in the world , and even commit any crimes to them such as murder, kidnapping etc in self defense or unnecessarily.

You can choose to be a good santa or an evil santa. Depending on which path you choose, you will have to battle with your counterpart at the end of the game to save the multiverse.
