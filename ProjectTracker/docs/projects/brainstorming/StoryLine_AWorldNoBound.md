    You should learn how to use a version control system like git and host your source code on github. Your university course will never teach that to you. Plus, use my zehanort soundboard app as your portfolio, guaranteed to get an internship.
    Malex: So what? If I want to , I can make a better app than him, and get even more downloads than him. Plus. why would I need to use github to host my assignments anyway? he is not even a computer science student, and he's saying all this things to me.
