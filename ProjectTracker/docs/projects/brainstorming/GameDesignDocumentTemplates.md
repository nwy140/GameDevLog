**Sample: Brainstorm Game**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets create a low-fi prototype of a polygon gaming app as a proof of concept. As
a new medium, users may not be familiar with virtual reality interactions yet.
Because the virtual reality canvas is infinite, guiding user focus and attention
presents unique challenges not present in 2D applications. This spec will cover
successful interactive patterns and how to avoid common design mistakes that
confuse users with virtual reality interfaces.

**Inspiration**

Lets shoot to create something that has the same look and feel that can be seen
in this video I found the other day.

Here are some other screenshots I found that I think could be really helpful as
a reference for when we start to design the visuals...

Here is a Pinterest board of more examples of the illustration style I�d like to
go with.

Regarding the soundtrack, I�d love to choose something that doesn't distract
from the game play, that we can loop easily. I found this track the other day
and I think something like this would pair well with the illustration style
above.

**Levels / Stages�**

Here are some ideas for the first few levels we discussed in our last meeting.
Please feel free to add or update these if you think I missed anything!

**Level 1**

**Objective:** to collect a set of exactly three shapes that add up to 15.

Progression of Play: on your turn, choose a shape that has not been chosen by
either player. You now control that shape. Cross it off the list of numbers, and
write the number on your side of the shape to show that it is now yours.

**Level 2**

**Objective:** to destroy outlier shapes in the set of 15 that do not match your
selected color.

Progression of Play: on your turn, select a color that has not been chosen by
either player. For this level only you now control that color . It will auto
selct from the task bar, and write the color on your side of the shape to show
that it is set.

**Level 3**

**Objective:** to alter color to coordinate with enemy shape locaitons.

Progression of Play: on your turn, follow the map to guide your shape to the
colored flag in enemy boundries that has not been chosen by either player. You
now control that shape. Cross it off the list of numbers, and write the number
on your side of the shape to show that it is now yours.�

**Game Mechanics**

Here is a quick sketch that we mocked up in the meeting yesterday. Just to
recap, if the cursor stays fixed in the center of the window, the user will have
to rotate and tilt the device on the x and y axis to select the different
objects that show up in the scene.

**Prototype functionality**

1.  Throw object

    1.  velocity

    2.  angle

    3.  ball can knock over elements

    4.  ball can miss elements

2.  Roll object

    1.  velocity

    2.  angle

    3.  ball can knock over elements

    4.  ball can miss elements

3.  Any other core actions we want to support?

4.  Select environment

    -   Upload avatar

    -   Unlock different objects to throw/roll

5.  Show leaderboard and the ability to invite friends

**Perspective and viewing**

The matrices for the perspective and viewing transforms and how using shaders
could be defined.
