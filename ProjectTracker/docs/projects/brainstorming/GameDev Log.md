# Games of this era 2018


Every Single mobile games I have played are all just a bunch of free to play endless cash grab. Here haven't been a single mobile game that I actually liked. Its all just the same. You get from one point to another or a point where you never seemed to reach and then you repeat the same thing over and over again. Trying to earn enough curreny or stars to unlock something new or just buy it with your own money. There's no uniqueness in these games. Just flawed repetition that traps their players in an endless cycle world that they will never seemed to get out of. That is what games are like right now in 2018. They all seemed the same and repetitive. If I'm going to make a game, I will discard all these flaws these games have in them,  everysingle time the player opens my games,  there's always somerhing new and unique. Wait... Doesnt that fit in the free to play model where players have to live in your game forever to get that content or just pay it with their own money? That got me thinking,  what is so special about the games in the past compared to these games. Oh I know,  you cannot pay your way out with virtual currencies,  and you get all your contents in the beginning. And every single level,  is different, you get different experiences every singlw time you play a level. Look at toy story racers, Twisted metal 2, crash bash, digimon world. All these games are unique, you get all the content in the beginning, there's such things as dlcs and daily new content and pay to wins shortcuts. You earn everything on your own and there is an eventual ending. And the games are actually fun and you actuslly feel connected to these games. And you would dedicate your time and energybinto playing and finishing these games. E
