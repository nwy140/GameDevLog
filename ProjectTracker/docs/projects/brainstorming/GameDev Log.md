Every Single mobile games I have played are all just a bunch of free to play endless cash grab. Here haven't been a single mobile game that I actually liked. Its all just the same. You get from one point to another or a point where you never seemed to reach and then you repeat the same thing over and over again. Trying to earn enough curreny or stars to unlock something new or just buy it with your own money. There's no uniqueness in these games. Just flawed repetition that traps their players in an endless cycle world that they will never seemed to get out of. That is what games are like in
