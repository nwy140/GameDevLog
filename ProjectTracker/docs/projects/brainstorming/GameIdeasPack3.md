Dev Lesson

First thing you should create is game level progression. That's what really matters at first.

design matters moreprogramming is the easy partplayer experience and the emotions you inflict on to them are importantmake the game attractive to thw eyes pf the kidFact?young people prefer games with swipe, tap and touch controls without buttons
