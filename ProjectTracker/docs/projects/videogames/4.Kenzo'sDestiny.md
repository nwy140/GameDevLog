If you have a completely seperate idea

Use the space below to write them down

Level Design

Each level will spawn wave of enemy as u say

- Each level is 5 wave ending with a boss
- I was thinking about the boss of the previous level became the normal enemy of the next level
- I will find the sprite for 5 different bosses.
- For the ending I will do the cutscene or you want ending with just gameover and restart button
- The final boss will be the type where they can do ranged attack???
- And i saw u added the shuriken sprite so, I was thinking about what if after defeating boss of the each level they will drop some shuriken for u and make it something like the player special move.

Additional feature (if possible)

- Add dashing for the player where when dashing the player can avoid the enemy attack.

Sacrifice must be made

Sacrifice portal

- You must grab 10 innocent NPCs and

throw them into the sacrifice portal in order to unlock the gate that is blocking the finishing line or unlock any other obstacles that are blocking your objectives

- you are originally a hero who kills lots of evil monsters , but you suddebly turn evil.
- After 2ndth level, your character accidentally killed his family, which causes him to go berserk. The character then goes to the nearest village and massacred all the villagers.
- Unlock bloodthirst mode
- Now you are a wanted ninja
- Everyone wants to kill you
- You must sacrifice / murder innocent people to activate bloodthirst node
- Bllodthirst mode make your ebemies afraid of you, and your damage increases by a lot.
- When you sacrifice /kill ebough innocent, the people hiding inside the chain/gate that are blocking your path will exit and run away, unlocking them for youu
