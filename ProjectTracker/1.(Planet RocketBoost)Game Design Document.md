Feedback 
- peototypre first design later
- simpler game are more fun especially those that requires only tap and swipe
- display controls on screen so layers dont get confused
- players must be able to gey through ghe first level easily or else they will be cinfused and they wont find the game fun /
- firdt impression matters
- colors visual and surprises matters
- go to a different country, its a better experience
- if a gamedev university wants you, they will take you
- everygame is different
- simple to play games are fun because they experience instant gratification when they think they are progressing
-multiple paths you can go to. You can go fof exploration or battle or funny simple hyper casual or mmba style
Faster pace to fit with synthwave music
